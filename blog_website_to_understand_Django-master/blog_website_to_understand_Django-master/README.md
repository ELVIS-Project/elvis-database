# blog_website_to_understand_Django

A simple blog website that contains the core elements of Django, where you can login, logout. Submit forms (posts), comments. drafts and so on. You will understand the core elements of Django, if you understand how this website works.

So far, I have already commented codes in the project, and I will comment in great details in the future, and this `README` file so give you a clear documentation about how does this website works, and will refer to some tutorials to you when necessary. Stay tuned!

## How to set up the environment:

(1) `git clone` the whole project.
(2) Create a virtual environment under the project folder `blog_website_to_understand_Django`.
(3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages (NOTE: Django version must be greater than `2.0`!).
(4) Run `python manage.py runserver` to run the project.

If the guidelines above do not make sense to you, you might need to start [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/) from the beginning until you understand the content of this file.

Note: To log in, use `USERNAME: debug` and `PASSWORD:debugdebug` to log in. If possible, I will develop a function for the users to register themselves as well.
